HTTP/1.1:



1. Sequential Resource Retrieval: Resources are requested and delivered sequentially, leading to potential delays in loading web pages.

2. No Multiplexing: Lacks native multiplexing support, resulting in slower performance when multiple resources need to be fetched.

3. Plain Text Headers: Headers are sent in plaintext with each request and response, which can increase data transfer size.

4. Limited Server Control: The server has limited control over resource delivery; the client initiates all requests.

5. No Resource Prioritization: Resources are fetched without a clear priority, potentially causing critical resources to be delayed by non-critical ones.

6. Text-Based Protocol: Relies on a human-readable, text-based protocol, which isn't as efficient for machines.

7. Limited Browser Support: Older browsers may not fully support HTTP/1.1 features, impacting performance.

8. No Built-in Header Compression: Lacks built-in header compression, which can lead to larger header sizes and slower communication.

9. No Server Push: Server push isn't a feature in HTTP/1.1, meaning the server can't proactively send resources to the client.

10.Backward Compatibility: HTTP/1.1 is backward compatible with older HTTP/1.0, ensuring compatibility with legacy systems.



HTTP/2:



1. Parallel Resource Retrieval: Supports parallel resource retrieval, reducing latency and improving web page loading times.

2. Multiplexing: Allows for multiple resource requests and deliveries over a single connection, significantly boosting performance.

3. Header Compression: Utilizes header compression to reduce overhead, saving bandwidth and speeding up communication.

4. Server Push: Enables server push, allowing the server to send resources to the client before they are requested.

5. Resource Prioritization: Supports resource prioritization, ensuring that critical resources are delivered first.

6. Binary Protocol: Employs a binary protocol that's more efficient for machine processing.

7. Modern Browser Support: Most modern browsers support HTTP/2, ensuring widespread adoption.

8. Enhanced Performance: Generally delivers faster and more efficient web experiences.

9. Built-in Header Compression: Built-in support for header compression, reducing header sizes for better performance.

10.Continued Evolution: Represents a significant step in the evolution of HTTP, with ongoing improvements and refinements in the pipeline.
